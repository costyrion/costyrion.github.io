## The Problem Statement

In a world marked by global competition and rapid change, the importance of accurate and efficient costing has never been greater. Applying a higher costing maturity level requires adopting advanced costing methodologies and tools, that focus not only on enhancing accuracy but also on providing speed in delivering crucial information for decision-making and in responding to change requests.

Legacy software systems often fail to match the pace of modern business, especially when trying to implement real-time analytics on top of monolithic, period-focused accounting systems. The need to integrate this delayed financial data with operational data for cost calculations, coupled with the lack of interfaces for smooth integration, makes implementations and change requests both lengthy and costly.

In larger and more operationally diverse businesses, the complexity of the costing model, rules, and workflows for classifying and describing costs grows exponentially. Relying heavily on human input at such a scale leads to poor data quality and inconsistency. Additionally, implementing change requests for such complex rule systems and workflows becomes increasingly challenging, further compromising the system's reliability and adaptability.

Costing methodologies like ABC, GPK, RCA/RPCA often fall short in real-world applications, not due to their logical principles, which can indeed offer value, but because they depend on outdated legacy software and poor design practices.
